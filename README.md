## Introduction

In the realm of JavaScript development, mastering Promises is crucial for efficient and elegant asynchronous programming. This repository provides code examples corresponding to the Medium guide, aiming to help developers understand and apply Promises effectively in their projects.

## Use Cases and Real-World Examples

The code examples in this repository demonstrate several use cases discussed in the Medium article, including fetching data from an API, WebSocket communication, request batching, caching, intelligent prefetching and many more.

## Getting Started

To use and experiment with the code examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaScript-Promises-Guide-Code.git`
2. Navigate to the desired code example directory.
3. Open the code file in your preferred editor and experiment with the code.
4. You can run codes with Node.js but some code must run in the browser to see the effect.
